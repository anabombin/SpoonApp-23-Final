# SpoonApp-23-Final
Final Python: Data, Science and Design final for Spring 23
With this site, the user will be able to enter a list of ingredients that they already have and the site will return a list of 10 recipes that make use of those ingredients. The hope with using this app is that less food will go to wast because it has been sitting in the cabinet or the fridge for too long, and encourage mroe people to learn and experiements with new recipes.
Additionally, the site will give some basic information of each recipe: servings, time, image and of course, a link to an external site with the full recipe to follow.
